                                                     Form Validation using Javascript.

Html page includes three textboxes for username, password and phone number, one “Validate” button and one empty paragraph at the end of the page. 
When user clicks on the button, the user input is validated by using Javascript. 

Validation rules: 
1. All fields are mandatory.
2. Username and password should be at least 6 characters.
3. Phone number should include only numbers.


If user input is valid, text for paragraph is changed and success message is displayed. 
The text color for the success message will be green.

If it is not valid, text for paragraph is changed and it will show all errors. 
The text color for the error messages will be red.

Event handlers in javascript dynamically change CSS  style properties of elements.
