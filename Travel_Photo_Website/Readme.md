TRAVEL PHOTO SHARING WEBSITE BY MAITREYEE MHASAKAR

This is one of the short projects I did as part of my coursework.
This is a HTML code that uses CSS,jQuery to display images as a travel photo sharing website.
One of the cool feature is that , when the user hovers the pointer on the image, 
rest all images remain coloured and only selected image appears black and white. 
When user hovers over an image, it displays a larger coloured version of the same image. 

output_screenshot.png is the output.
Please run the file in firefox as chrome might have issues with javascript.
